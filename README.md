# alaface.github.io (starter)

Static mirror of Antonio Laface's UdeC website for GitHub Pages.

## How to use

1. Create the repo on GitHub named `alaface.github.io`.
2. Copy these files into the repo and push to `main`.
3. Enable **Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → main / root**.
4. Drop your existing content inside matching folders:
   - PDFs into `notes/` (e.g. `notes/oct-18.pdf`)
   - Software packages into `software/` (e.g. `software/coxrs.zip` and a `coxrs.html` page)
   - Paper list in `papers/index.html` (or link to ORCID/MathSciNet)
5. If you need subdirectory sites, create more folders with their own `index.html` files.
